This is an unofficial trimmed down version of `lubuntu-desktop` with 
many of its [`Depends`](https://github.com/suntong/lubuntu-desktop-trim/blob/master/debian/control#L13) [moved to/as `Recommends`](https://github.com/suntong/lubuntu-desktop-trim/commits/master).

The changes are made here manually, instead of changing to the [Lubuntu Seed][1] and then programmatically make changes here.
